*Posted 01 March, 2015*

Pioneer Rebel has been (cleanly) merged into the Zedom8or repo:
https://github.com/QuinnEbert/zedom8or <= the 'PioneerRebel' directory

Please update your forks (if you can) and base all future forks off of that repo as it is where all future work on PR will happen.  Also, there's a ton more fun stuff to tinker around with in there. :)

**BONUS:** as of this writing, as far as I know, you should be able to (effectively) re-base forks based on PR directly off the Z8 repo without any merging on the Git side of things -- I don't think I've changed anything of substance that didn't get backported here previously.
